<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Since the socialization of children plays an important factor in their growth, we decided to bring them together with our mobile app. 'Scavenger's Assemble' helps children continue to interact and play together even through the COVID-19 quarantine. The app allows a teacher/ parent to host a scavenger hunt game for the children where they can join a game with their friends and play together in real-time. The app leverages the mobile camera, where children can take pictures of items from the scavenger's list.

### Built With

The front-end of the application was designed using Adobe XD and implemented through React-Native and Expo for cross-platform mobile use. The multiplayer support was handled on the backend using Google Firebase's Realtime Database to keep all players in sync. Meanwhile the photos taken in game is sent to Google Cloud's Vision AI to identify if an item found is correct or incorrect.
